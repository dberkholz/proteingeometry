To install the Protein Geometry Database library-access modules, just run:

python setup.py install

See `pgd-angles --help` for more information.

The get_geom_rmsd.py script depends on the pymmlib library. It requires 
you to make a slight change to the file AtomMath.py, in the function 
calc_torsion_angle(): uncomment these two lines:

#    if direction<0.0:
#        angle = -angle

This is required to allow for negative phi and psi angles.
