<p>
This service creates the input required to restrain a protein model to the CDL using
the <i>shelxl</i> refinment program.  It needs a structural model in PDB format to calculate
the backbone conformational angles.  <i>shelxl</i> can only work with models that have a
single "chain" and the name of that chain must be blank.  To avoid these problems your model needs to be processed
by <i>shelxpro</i> before it is submitted to this service. 
</p><p>
The use of these restraints in refinement is described in <A href="http://pgd.science.oregonstate.edu/references/static/pdf/2011_tronrud-shelxl.pdf"><cite>Tronrud & Karplus, <i>acta Cryst D</i>, in press</cite><A>.
